However you're feeling - hurt, angry, numb, or even laughing through the tears - I want you to know this first: I love you. Deeply, endlessly, and with all I had.\n\nBecause I'm me 😆, I also built something to leave pieces of myself with you. I called it Argus. It holds the things I've written, messages like this one, and a few notes and recordings I made just for you. When you miss me, or need to hear my voice, or want to remember who we were together, Argus is there. I tried to make it simple, so you can find what you need without too much difficulty.\n\nThank you for being one of the most beautiful parts of my life - no matter the size or shape of your role. I hope you always knew how much you mean to me. I carried your love with me every day, and I'll keep watching over you as best I can, the way you watched over me.\n\nKeep your head up. Keep going. Love each other well.\n\nI love you. Always. 🖤"
